1 How to Exclude packages:
Double click the shift twice quickly and type excludes and hit enter:
From the pop up window an click + button and select the packages that yuo want to execute.
How Java code is compiled / execute on a computer.
We write the code in file with extension .java
once we hit the run button a software program called compiler checks this code,
 for error and convert it to byte code. usualy stored in a folder called bin/out.
 JVM another software further converts this code to binary code and this binary,
 code is what is excludes on your computer.
 ---------------------------------------------
Why we should packages and class from compiling:
In intellej if we a syntax error in any of the file in a project we can't run the project another
file unless and until we fix that error. Sometimes time we want to execute code in some files without
fixing those issue this is where we should exc.
-----------------------------------------------
Methods in Java:
Method is a block of code. or some java statements (any code with;)grouped together.
Why we should learn about the methods.
Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
F.exp if piece of code is being repeated again,
we can create a method for it and simple call that method whenever we need that logic again.
Syntax of creating methods:
 we can create methods only inside a class
 [Datatype][mathod name][(datatype and variable name ---parameters)][method body].
 [Datatype] can we void, boolean, String int etc
 [method name ] they are like variable names .
 [Datatype variable names] used to pass data while calling method.
How do we dicide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword1.
 If we are building a method that will be used by other or in other parts of your code which require
 some data from your meyhod like condition we should not create methods with void type.

===========================================
Types of varialbles with respect to ther scape:
There are 3 types of varialbles with respect to there scope:
1. Local variables
2.Instance variables
3. static variables

---Local varialbles
A var-ble that created inside a method switch case any bloc of code called local variable;
WHEN WHEN WE SHOULD use local variables:
**Local variables occupy the computer memory for the amount of time,we should be used local variables,
but, there are limited with in scope we can't use local variables out side of the block in which the are declared.

F.ex for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
System.out.print(i);
}
---Instance variables.
which are declared outside of a block of code but, inside a class are called instance variables.
Int num=1; instance varibles
F.ex for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
System.out.print(i);
}
When we should use  instance variable.
when we are planing to create multiply objects of a class or we want to share something multiply methods,
we should go with instance variables, they occupy the memory for longer as compare to local variables.


---- Static variables.
if an instance has a keyword static with it it called a static variables.
static String name="Rimma";

When we should use static variables?
When we need to share something across the objects. We use static variables.
but, it occupies the memory longest amount of time.
