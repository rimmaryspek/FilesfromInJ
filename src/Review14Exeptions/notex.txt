Exceptions:
    It's an unwanted behaviour that occurs at run time and disturbs the normal flow of a program.
Why we should learn about exception?
    1) We can use exceptions to figure the exact line of code and can also get an explanation about
        that error.
    2) When we are building applications for other users like Google Chrome,Discord,Zoom etc. we can
    use Exception handling to improve the user experience when we handle exception applications no
    longer terminate abruptly.
    3) To convert complex system generated error messages to something that everyone can understand.
What is the syntax:
    we can handle exceptions using try catch block.
    we can also utilize finally block, and we use some new keywords like throw and throws.
try-catch block:
    try{
    // the code that might cause some problems
    }catch( The name of the class whose exception we are expecting){

    //Backup code or the code that we want to execute in case the code in try block fails.
    }
    finally{

    // the code that we want to execute no matter what happens in try or catch block
    // for example closing the critical system resources like files releasing database connection etc.
    }
Throw keyword:
    We use throw keyword to through the exceptions.
throws:
    when we want to avoid writing a try catch block we can use throws keyboard with method header to
    throw this responsibility to the caller of the method. It bad we should avid it if we know how to
    handle an exception.
