Overriding:
Method overriding allow us to have same name or methods in the parent class and child class , but on the execution different print.
Why we should override a method?
1.If we inherit from the class everything other than private methods and constructors is inherited ,
if we don't like any method from parent we can override.
2. It help us to archive polymorphism.
Syntax of the overriding:
1) First there much parent and child relationship
2) In the child class redefine the method.
Type casting in objects;
as we can typecast in primitive also we can also type cast in objects.
like storing the object of a child in a variable of parent.
With the hepls of type cast we can start storing the object child classes in a array of the parent.

What is the syntax of type cast.
It is same is primitive tipe casting
F.ex if we have animal class and animal class has a child class cat we can do.
Animal animal = new Cat();

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is the ability of the method to take on many form base on the object or the parameters that we pass to the methond.
There are two types of polymorphism:
1)Compile time/static/arly binding or run time/dynamic or late binding.
when we use overloading to achieve polymorphism it is called compile time polymorphism.
**Run time/dynamic or late binding.
 When we use mothod overriding to achieve poly-sm it call run time pol-sm.

 Final keyword;
 Final keyword just like any other keyword like class/package/void....
 There are 3 main uses of final keyword.
 1)
 2)If we use with method name no child class can override that method.
 2)If we use with a fils ones value has been assing th that fild no one can chage the value afterwrds.
 3)
