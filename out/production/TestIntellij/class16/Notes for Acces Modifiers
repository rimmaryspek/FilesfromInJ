Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords which control the access or fields or methods or class itselt.
They are 4 access levels nad 3 access modifiers keywords.
This are ony applicable to instance or static variables, not to local variables.

1.Private:Is the most restricted one if you used private with any variables or method,
we can only access it whiten the class
Only inside the class or method can be used.
When we should use private access modifier? In OOPS always use private access modifier.
We should always try to create variables as private.
---Up-site of the private - its secure all the time.
The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.
---Down- site - is you can only use only in the class.
2. Default access modifier:
Default is not a keyword whenever we what to assign any access modifier keyword like public or private,
Java assigns default access level to those variables and method.
We can use the default access level within the same class or any other class that is present inside the same package.

3. Public access modifier:
All the variables that mentioned as public can be shared to all packges and classes.
public access most unrestricted access modifier.
Once used with an variables or method within a project.

we can have only one public class in a file and the name of the class and should match the name of file.
