What is inheritance:
it's a mechanizim through which class can inherit the properties and method of another class.
why we should lean inheritance;
it let us a void code duplication.
it help's us save space.
it hepls us improve the execution speed as well;
What's is syntax:
We use extends keyword and the name of the class which we want to inherit the fields and methods while declaring the class.

There can be 4 types of inheritance, but in Java class we use only 3 types.
-Single
-MultiLevel
-Hierarchal
-Multiple -it's not supported by classes in Java.

----Single inheritance when we have only one parent and one child class it is called SH and not widely used.

----Multilevel inheritance ----One top level onr base class and many intermediate classes.
For.ex A<B<C<D classes.

----Hierarchical inheritance when we one parent and multiple classes it is called Hierarchical.

-----Multiple Inheritance;
One child and multiple parents,It is not supported in java, cuz is diamond problem-

------------------------------------------------------------
Super keyword: is
--We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class.
--When we have same name instance variable in child class and parent class.
--We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.
=========================================================================
MethodOverLoading:
   Method over leading allows us to create multiple methods in the class with same class name.
   Why we should create multiple methods with same name;
-It gives the end user flexibility.
-The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different results.

How do we overload method?
 --By passing different number of parameters.
 --By changing the datatype.
 --By changing the sequence of parameters.(like String to int or int to String positions)
